# HABLA Lexical Resources


This is a code to aligh discourse markers equivalents groups between Spanish and Portuguese based on the translation of indivisuals markers. In this repository, they are also available the discourse marker lexicons which along with a number of heuristics can support the task of automatically detecting and correcting discourse marker errors made by native Spanish speakers in their academic writing in Portuguese. These resources integrate a module of the HABLA (Hispanic speakers acquiring a Base of Academic Language) project, an academic writing support tool in Portuguese for native Spanish speakers.
